# Practicing-Scripts 📚

This repository contains my **practical programming studies** and serves as a **continuous record of my technical growth** throughout my degree in **Software Engineering**.

It includes training scripts, logic exercise solutions, and small code snippets developed during academic studies and self-directed learning. The focus is not only on final results, but on the **learning process**, concept reinforcement, and the development of problem-solving skills.

This repository also works as a personal reference for reviewing syntax, core programming structures, and previously explored solutions.

## 🧠 Areas of Study

All content in this repository is **educational in nature**, aimed at strengthening fundamental programming concepts:

### Shell Script / Bash

* Logic exercises applied to the command-line environment
* Loop structures (`for`, `while`, `until`)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `case`)
* Basic file and directory manipulation
* Simple task automation on Unix-like systems

### SQL

* Practice queries focusing on **DQL** (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`)
* **DML** operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
* Logic applied to relational databases
* Emphasis on data querying, filtering, and organization

### Python

* Short scripts focused on programming logic
* Conditional statements and loop structures
* Manipulation of lists, dictionaries, and strings
* Problem-solving and quick prototyping

## 🎯 Repository Goals

* Strengthen core programming fundamentals
* Develop and reinforce logical thinking
* Maintain a structured learning history
* Enable efficient technical review and knowledge reuse
* Complement academic studies with continuous hands-on practice
